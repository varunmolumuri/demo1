VPC and subnet basics

*A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
*It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. 
*You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.

When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the 
form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block;

>for example, 10.0.0.0/16. This is the primary CIDR block for your VPC.

>If  a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a 
public subnet.
>If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.

>if you create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, it supports 256 IP addresses. 

>You can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP addresses.

>One subnet uses CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) 
>the other uses CIDR block 10.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255).

>When we create subnet ,AWS will engage 5 ip address.

>The first four IP addresses and the 
>last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you to use,
   and cannot be assigned to an instance.  
   
1)10.0.0.0: Network address.

2)10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.

3)10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. 
   The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two. 
   For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in 
   the primary CIDR. We also reserve the base of each subnet range plus two for 
    all CIDR blocks in the VPC. 

4)10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.

5)10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. 
  We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.
